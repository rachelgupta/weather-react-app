# ☀️ Weather React App

A simple and user-friendly **Weather Application** built using **React**.  
This app allows users to search for a city and view real-time weather information using a public Weather REST API.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of **React core concepts** while building something practical and interactive.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me master the following React concepts:

- **Components** – building reusable UI blocks
- **useState** – managing city search input and weather data
- **useEffect** –  
  - fetching weather on component mount  
  - fetching user’s current location
- **REST API Integration** –  
  - fetching weather data  
  - handling JSON responses
- **React Context API** –  
  - sharing state across multiple components  
  - keeping UI in sync when state updates

## 🚀 How It Works

1. On initial load, the app fetches the user's current location.
2. Weather data is retrieved using a Weather REST API.
3. Users can search for any city using the search input.
4. Clicking the **Search** button fetches updated weather information.
5. All data is shared across components using Context API.
