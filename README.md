# Weather-React-App
This is a simple weather App that I have built using React.

In this project I have mastered React core concepts like - 

1. **Components**
2. **useState** - To set the name of the city we are searching
3. **useEffect** - To make changes while mounting - use to fetch current location
4. **REST API** - weather API to fetch weather info and return in JSON format
5. **React Context API** - How to use states by different components so that changes are reflected in each

Anyone can easily download the project and run it using 'npm start'
